%%% bottom, one to the top and a third one which should be in between, you
%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle
%%% box.

   %\item A method to compute superpixel matchings (The superpixel flow).
   %\item A segmentation method for objects in video (Background regions tracking).
   %\item A framework to combine object trackers and optical flow methods.
   %\item A method to extend the Simple Flow method to use input segmentation masks.
   %\item A better sampling method for tracking-by-detection methods.
