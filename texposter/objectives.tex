An approach to incorporate the trifocal tensor estimated from the calibrated three-view geometry into the visual servoing control loop task is proposed. This approach presents a generalized 6-DOF visual servoing task, with the control loop being closed over projective measures, namely the trifocal tensor coefficients. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first to propose a fully analytical design for a 6-DOF visual servoing task based on the trifocal tensor \cite{lopez2010visual}\cite{shademan2010three}.
