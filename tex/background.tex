\chapter{Background} \label{chap:background}

In this chapter, we review the basics and concepts for visual servoing and the three-view geometry. We present the Trifocal Tensor definition, how to recover 3D pose from the tensor, and how to compute the trifocal tensor from points correspondences across different views images. Also we present the basic framework for visual servoing control systems, and the main approaches used in the field. Based on these basics we can develop the needed method combining the mathematics from both sides. We also review the previous works that tackled using the three-view geometry into the visual servoing control loop system.
