\chapter{Background} \label{chap:background}

In this chapter, we review the basics and concepts for visual servoing and the three-view geometry. Based on these basics we can develop the needed method combining the mathematics from both sides. We also review the previous works that tackled using the the three-view geometry into the visual servoing control loop system.
